# Vagrant ArcGIS Enterprise

This is a project to get ArcGIS Enterprise up and running using a Vagrant file on Ununtu Linux. Using this project requires VirtualBox and Vagrant to be installed and set up on your host machine. Futher, you need to procure your own installation files and license files. Once fulfilling these two requirements, you have everything you need to quickly, in Vagrant parlance, provision an ArcGIS Enterprise environment.

## Current Status: 09 Feb 2017

Right now all I have been able to sucessfully do is get ArcGIS Server installed, and ready to set up or join an ArcGIS Server site.
